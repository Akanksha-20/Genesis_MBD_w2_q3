Cruise Control Model with a PI controller
Consider the Cruise Control Model. Build this system in Simulink.
Design a controller (P, PI, PD or PID) to achieve following goals with basic building
bocks
• Rise time < 5 s
• Overshoot < 10%
• Steady-state error < 2%
Build a reference model to use the PID along with this system. Use Data Dictionary.
